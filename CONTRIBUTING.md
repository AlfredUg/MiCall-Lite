### Java and Python ###
1. Check that you are running a 64-bit operating system, or bowtie2 won't work.
   Check About this Computer under the gear menu.
2. If you want to edit Python code using PyDev and Eclipse, you will need to
   install Java. Check the version of Java you have installed:

        java -version
 
3. If the java version is lower than 1.7, then install JDK7:

        sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-source

4. Check that you are now using the new version. If not, configure it.

        java -version
        sudo update-alternatives --config java 
        java -version

5. Check the version of Python you have installed:

        python --version

6. If the Python version is lower than 2.7, then install it:
        
        sudo apt-get install python2.7
        
7. Install [pip the Python package manager][pip] and a couple of packages for Python:

        sudo apt-get install python-pip
        sudo pip install testfixtures
        sudo pip install requests

### Eclipse ###
1. Install Eclipse, although you might prefer a more recent version from the [Eclipse web site][eclipse]:

        sudo apt-get install eclipse

2. Launch Eclipse. From the Help menu, choose either Eclipse Marketplace... or Install New Software....
3. In the marketplace, just type PyDev and search. In the install wizard, use the [PyDev update site][pydev].
4. After installing PyDev, open Window: Preferences. Navigate down to PyDev: Interpreters: Python Interpreter. 
5. Click the Quick Auto-Config button. Click OK.
6. From the File menu, choose Import.... Navigate down to Git: Projects from Git.
7. Choose Clone URI, and paste this URI: https://github.com/cfe-lab/MiCall.git
8. Take all the branches, and select master as your initial branch.
9. Select import existing projects, and finish the import.

### Perl, Bowtie, Samtools, and Hyphy ###
1. Check that Perl is installed by running `perl --version`. On Windows, you
    can install [ActivePerl][perl].
1. Download the latest version of [bowtie2's binaries for Linux][bowtie2].
2. Right click and choose Extract Here. Change the folder owner to root, move it to /opt, and add it to the path.

        chmod g-w -R bowtie2-2.2.1
        sudo chown root:root -R bowtie2-2.2.1
        sudo mv bowtie2-2.2.1 /opt
        sudo vi /etc/environment # add :/opt/bowtie2-2.2.1 and logout/login
        bowtie2 --version # smoke test

3. Samtools doesn't seem to be available for Windows, so skip it. Before you can
    build samtools on Ubuntu, you will need these libraries:

        sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev libncurses5-dev

4. Download the latest version of the [source for samtools][samtools].
5. Extract the files, and follow the instructions in the INSTALL file. Copy the
    samtools executable to /usr/bin/samtools-X.Y where X.Y is the version of
    samtools. You can check the samtools version by running `samtools-X.Y` with
    no arguments.
6. Hyphy is not needed by the main pipeline, only some of the helper utilities,
    so you can probably skip it. Before you can build HyPhy, you will need these
    libraries:

        sudo apt-get install build-essential python-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libcrypto++-dev libssl-dev

7. Download the latest [source for HyPhy][hyphy]. Right click the zip file and choose Expand Here. Then run the setup script:

        cd ~/Downloads/hyphy-master/src/lib
        sudo python setup.py install

    You can test it out if you like.

        cd Examples/Python
        python BasicHyPhy.py # Just check that there are no obvious errors.

### Gotoh library ###
MiCall uses an implementation of a modified Gotoh algorithm for pairwise sequence alignment.
This is written in the C++ source file `gotoh.cpp`.  To compile this into a shared library
that can be accessed from Python, go to `micall/alignment` and enter the following:
```
sudo python setup.py install
```
This assumes that you have superuser permissions on your system.  We have tested this
installation on OS-X and Ubuntu. If you're installing on Windows, you will need
to [install Visual C++ for Python][vcpp].

### R ###
R is used in the MISEQ_MONITOR version, but not in the stand-alone version.

1. Install R.

        sudo apt-get install r-base r-base-dev

2. In R, install the rj, rj.gd, and jsonlite packages.  First, invoke R using sudo,
    so that packages can be installed system-wide:

        sudo R

   Next, in the resulting R console:

        install.packages(c("rj", "rj.gd"), repos="http://download.walware.de/rj-2.0")  # your repo may vary
        install.packages("jsonlite")
        q()  # quit

   Note that the repository must be specified for the rj and rj.gd packages.  You 
    should check the [StatET installation page][statet] to see exactly which version
    of the rj package is compatible with the version of StatET you are going to
    install, and which repository to use.

3. Launch Eclipse. For some reason, you can't currently install StatET from the
    Eclipse Marketplace, so from the Help menu, choose Install New Software....
4. Go to the [StatET installation page][statet], and find the update site for
    your version of Eclipse. Paste that address in the install wizard, and 
    select the StatET for R component. Finish the installation.
5. From the Window menu, choose Preferences. Navigate down to StatET: 
    Run/Debug: R Environments.
6. Click the Add... button.
7. Next to the Location (R_HOME) field, press the + button, and choose Try
    find automatically. It should find the R you just installed.
8. Click the Detect Default Properties/Settings button. Click OK. Click OK.
9. From the Window menu, choose Preferences. Navigate down to 
    StatET: R Code Formatting. Change the policy to use spaces. Click OK.
10. If you want an R console, open the Run menu, and choose 
    Run Configurations.... Select R Console and click the add button. Click Run.
11. To run an R script with command-line arguments, modify the R console 
    configuration by setting the working directory and adding this to the 
    Options/Arguments field with whatever CSV file name was created by the
    previous step:
    
        --args /path/to/amino_frequencies.csv /path/to/coverage_maps
    
    Then you can use `source("coverage_plots.R")` in the console to launch it.

### MPI ###
MPI is only used in the MISEQ_MONITOR version, not in the stand-alone version.

1. Install Open MPI.

    sudo apt-get install openmpi-bin
    
2. Install mpi4py.

    sudo apt-get install python-mpi4py
    
### PyInstaller ###
If you want to distribute a stand-alone Windows executable version, you need
to use [PyInstaller][pyinstaller].

1. If you haven't done all the previous steps, install Python and PyWin32.
2. Install ActivePerl and bowtie2.
3. Install [git for Windows][wingit], and clone the MiCall repository.
4. Follow the instructions above to install the Gotoh package from the
    `micall/alignment` folder.
5. Use pip to install pyinstaller.

    cd \Python27\Scripts
    pip install pyinstaller


[pyinstaller]: https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller
[wingit]: https://git-scm.com/download/win

### Running the code ###
1. Copy settings_default.py to settings.py, and open it for editing.
3. Change `counting_processes` to match the number of processors on your
   computer, and set `mapping_processes` to be that number divided by four.
5. Copy hostfile_default to hostfile, and open it for editing.
6. You probably just want to uncomment the localhost line.
7. Try the launch configurations. They are saved in the `micall/tests/working`
    directory, but you should see them if you open the Run menu and choose Run
    configurations.... If you want to run all steps at once, skip to the next
    step, otherwise go through the numbered launch configurations in order.
8. Copy or link all the files from the microtest folder to the working folder.
9. Run the sample_pipeline or run_processor launch configurations. They will
    process all the sample files in the working folder. 
12. Run the unit tests. Either run them from Eclipse, or run them from the
    command line like this:

        cd ~/git/MiCall
        python -m unittest discover -p '*_test.py'
    
### Test data ###
If you want to run MISEQ_MONITOR.py, you have to set up data folders for raw
data and for the working folders. You'll also need to set up the QAI project
and the MiseqQCReport so you can download QC data and upload results.

1. Create a data folder somewhere on your workstation, like ~/data. Create
   subdirectories called miseq and RAW_DATA. Add folders RAW_DATA/MiSeq/runs.
2. Connect to the shared drive [using CIFS][cifs] and mount 
   smb://192.168.68.144/RAW_DATA as /media/RAW_DATA.
3. Navigate down to /media/RAW_DATA/MiSeq/runs, pick a recent folder, and make
   sure it has a file named needsprocessing.
4. Copy SampleSheet.csv to a sample run folder under your local
   RAW_DATA/MiSeq/runs folder.
5. Navigate down to Data\Intensities\BaseCalls, and copy a few of the .fastq.gz
   files to your sample run folder under Data/Intensities/BaseCalls.
5. Copy the Interop folder and the files RunInfo.xml and runParameters.xml.
6. Open settings.py for editing.
7. Point `home` at your local data/miseq folder.
8. Point `rawdata_mount` at your local RAW_DATA folder.
9. Set the Oracle connection information to a test database where you can upload
   sequence data.
10. Run the Ruby console for QAI and `LabMiseqRun.import('01-Jan-2000')` for the
    date of your sample run.
11. Run the MiSeqQCReport script to upload the QC data from the sample run
    folder.
12. Run MISEQ_MONITOR.py, it doesn't take any arguments.

### Looking at SAM files ###
When you don't understand the pipeline's output, it can be helpful to look at
the raw reads in a sequence viewer like [Tablet][tablet]. Change the settings
file on your workstation to not delete the temp folders, then run the pipeline
on a run with a single sample. Look through the temp folders to find the one
for the step you're interested in. For the remap step, the final remap results
are stored in a SAM file named for the seed region. You also have to edit the
`cfe.fasta` file and rename that seed region to "0", because the SAM file uses
the region name "0" instead of the proper region name. Once you've done that,
you should be able to open an assembly in Tablet using the SAM file and the
edited FASTA file.

### Releases ###
This section assumes you already have a working server up and running, and you
just want to publish a new release. If you're setting up a new server, follow
similar steps to setting up a development workstation. Follow these steps:

1. Make sure the code works in your development environment. Run all the unit
    tests as described above, process the microtest data set, and process a full
    run using MISEQ_MONITOR.py from the command line. Check the logs for errors.
    Also check that all the issues in the current milestone are closed.
2. Determine what version number should be used next. Update the version number
    in `settings_default.py` if it hasn't been updated already, commit, and push.
2. Copy the previous pipeline on QAI/lab_miseq_pipelines to make a new version.
    Use the `dump_projects.py` script and compare `projects.json` to check that
    the projects match.
3. [Create a release][release] on Github. Use "vX.Y" as the tag, where X.Y
    matches the version you used in `settings_default.py`. If you have to redo
    a release, you can create additional releases with tags vX.Y.1, vX.Y.2, and
    so on. Mark the release as pre-release until you finish deploying it.
4. Get the code from Github into the server's development environment.

        ssh user@server
        cd /usr/local/share/miseq/development/
        git fetch
        git checkout tags/vX.Y

5. Check if you need to set any new settings by running
    `diff settings_default.py settings.py`. You will probably need to modify
    the version number, at least. Make sure that `production = False`, and the
    process counts are half the production values. Do the same comparison of
    `hostfile`.
6. Check if `alignment.cpp` is newer than `alignment.so`. If so, rebuild it.

        cd /usr/local/share/miseq/development/
        ./build_alignment.sh
        
7. Process one full run of data.

        cd /usr/local/share/miseq/development/
        ./run_processor.py /data/miseq/YYMMDD*

7. Stop the `MISEQ_MONITOR.py` process after you check that it's not processing
    any runs.

        ssh user@server
        tail /data/miseq/MISEQ_MONITOR_OUTPUT.log
        ps aux|grep MISEQ_MONITOR.py
        sudo kill -9 <process id from grep output>

8. Get the code from Github into the server's production environment.

        ssh user@server
        cd /usr/local/share/miseq/production/
        git fetch
        git checkout tags/vX.Y

9. Review the settings, host file, and alignment library just as you did in the
    development environment, but make sure that `production = True`.
10. Start the monitor, and tail the log to see that it begins processing all the
    runs with the new version of the pipeline.

        cd /usr/local/share/miseq/production/
        python MISEQ_MONITOR.py &>/dev/null &
        tail -f /data/miseq/MISEQ_MONITOR_OUTPUT.log

11. Remove the pre-release flag from the release.
12. Send an e-mail to users describing the major changes in the release.
13. Close the milestone for this release, create one for the next release, and
    decide which issues you will include in that milestone.
