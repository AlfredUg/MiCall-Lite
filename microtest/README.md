These sample files exercise certain features of the pipeline with tiny FASTQ
files that are very quick to process. To build them, we took reference
sequences from the projects.json file, and either took snippets from them
or introduced deletions, insertions, and variants.

This folder also contains some useful scripts for manipulating these sequences.

To process these samples, copy the FASTQ files and the sample sheet into the
working folder, then run the sample_pipeline or run_processor launch
configurations.
